    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hashbrown breakfast casserole is my family's recipe that has been handed down through the years. We've always used the maple-flavored pork sausage but any kind is good. This casserole is a nice and cozy breakfast or brunch meal that everyone will enjoy. It's got the perfect taste with lots of cheese. Yum! Be sure to use a baking dish that is deep enough to cover with aluminum foil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
        <li>1 pound pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>12 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan; add hash brown potatoes and arrange in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Place sausage and onion in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until the sausage is browned and crumbled, about 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk eggs, milk, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until well combined; pour over the potatoes and sprinkle with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese. Add sausage mixture on top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove foil; return casserole to the oven and bake until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
